<b>Postscript:</b> Sorry, I could not make it all because I am now busy with another project in Cambodia! At the beginning, I did not expect to do it much because I only had time to work only few hours at nights and, luckily, on Sunday. However, after coming to this stage, I feel contented with what I have built. When I come back to Vietnam, I will definitely try to finish the rest of the project! Finally, thank you a lot for giving me and others both <b>a great challenge</b> and <b>an amazing experience</b> to entangle in and disentangle from a new and robust programming language, <b>Swift</b>
